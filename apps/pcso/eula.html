            reasonable attorneys' fees, due to or arising out of your: (a) use of the Application; (b)
            violation of this Agreement or any law or regulation; or (c) violation of any right of a third
            party.</p>

        <h2>No Warranties</h2>
        <p>The Application is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects
            without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company,
            on its own behalf and on behalf of its affiliates and its and their respective licensors and
            service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or
            otherwise, with respect to the Application, including all implied warranties of merchantability,
            fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out
            of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the
            foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any
            kind that the Application will meet your requirements, achieve any intended results, be
            compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without
            interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors
            or defects can or will be corrected.</p>
        <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any
            representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or
            availability of the Application, or the information, content, and materials or products included
            thereon; (ii) that the Application will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the
            accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the
            Application; or (iv) that the Application, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on
            behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or
            other harmful components.</p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on
            applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and
            limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in
            this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law. To the
            extent any warranty exists under law that cannot be disclaimed, the Company shall be solely
            responsible for such warranty.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of
            its suppliers under any provision of this Agreement and your exclusive remedy for all of the
            foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You for the Application or through the
            Application if You haven't purchased anything through the Application.</p>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers
            be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including,
            but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business
            interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the
            use of or inability to use the Application, third-party software and/or third-party hardware
            used with the Application, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Agreement),
            even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even
            if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
        <p>Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
            damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to You.</p>

        <h2>Severability and Waiver</h2>
        <h4>Severability</h4>
        <p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be
            changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent
            possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and
            effect.</p>
        <h4>Waiver</h4>
        <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an
            obligation under this Agreement shall not affect a party's ability to exercise such right or
            require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a
            waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
        <h2>Product Claims</h2>
        <p>The Company does not make any warranties concerning the Application.</p>
        <h2>United States Legal Compliance</h2>
        <p>You represent and warrant that (i) You are not located in a country that is subject to the United
            States government embargo, or that has been designated by the United States government as a
            "terrorist supporting" country, and (ii) You are not listed on any United States government list
            of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>
        <h2>Changes to this Agreement</h2>
        <p>The Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement at
            any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new
            terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at the sole
            discretion of the Company.</p>
        <p>By continuing to access or use the Application after any revisions become effective, You agree to
            be bound by the revised terms. If You do not agree to the new terms, You are no longer
            authorized to use the Application.</p>

            the Application and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous written or oral agreements between

        <p>You may be subject to additional terms and conditions that apply when You use or purchase other
            Company's services, which the Company will provide to You at the time of such use or purchase.
